# Skeleton

Acceleration/rotational data from a Skeleton (sport) run at the Whistler Sliding Centre obtained from PowerSense on an iPhone in hmrpy.csv is processed here to create a numerical model. The model applies matrix rotations and techniques (in-situ and in the script) I developed by myself or through suggestions of the professor to correct for error in the data. The output is a real-time VPython model of the run along with graphs showing position, velocity, kinetic/potential energy, and aerodynamic drag/work.
