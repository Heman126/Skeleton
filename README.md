# Skeleton

Numerical analysis of acceleration/rotational data from a Skeleton (sport) run at the Whistler Sliding Centre obtained from PowerSense on an iPhone. The model applies matrix rotations and self-developed techniques (in-situ and in the script) to correct for error. The output is a real-time VPython model of the run along with graphs showing position, velocity, kinetic/potential energy, and aerodynamic drag/work.
